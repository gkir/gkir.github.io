Hello! I'm Greg, a sixth-year PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My work focuses on industrial organization, specializing in energy markets. I will be on the job market during the 2024-2025 academic year. 

Prior to starting the PhD program, I received my Bachelors from the College of William & Mary in 2015, where I majored in economics and mathematics. I then worked as an Economic Research Analyst at the Federal Trade Commission from 2015 to 2017, and completed a Masters in Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics (ESAM) from Northwestern University in 2018.
